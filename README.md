#### COMP 354 Assignment description:

Typical editing software have Undo capability which allows the user the undo the last edit
in a last-edit-first-undo manner. In the assignments and project for this course, you are going
to add Smart Undo capability to a simple text editor which can allow the user to
do the Undo operations in the following manner:
```
• Select specific edits in any order from a list and perform them in one step.

• Undo all the edits in a group of edits maintained by the user.

• Select different edits from different groups maintained by the user and undo them in one
step.

• Delete an arbitrarily selected list of edits so that they will no longer be available.

• Delete a complete group of edits so that that group will no longer be available.

• Delete all the edits so that no undo will be possible.
```
