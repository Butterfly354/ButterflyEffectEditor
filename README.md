You will find here the projet that I made which countains 4 tests plus a an additonal 
text file that you can use to try the project on the Selenium IDE extension on your browser.

-Create groups and delete all groups

-Create one group and delete a selected group

-Create one Group and delete

-Open FIle and Download File

This is not a final version, might have to try it in a different browser, while in chrome it seems the browser was block Selenium from running the tests completly.
